## About The Project

<p align="center">

</p>

This project is designed to assist long-established restaurants in their digital transformation, with a focus on reducing single-use utensil consumption. The project covers several key areas:

**Restaurant Website**: A custom website showcasing menus, hours, and announcements, strengthening brand awareness and connecting with customers.

**Raw Material Price API**: A real-time API that allows restaurant managers to track ingredient prices and make informed purchasing decisions based on up-to-date market data, ensuring cost efficiency.

**Customized Online Store Template**: A tailored online ordering platform that can be configured to meet specific needs, enabling restaurants to track and manage online orders while enhancing customer convenience.

**Reducing Single-Use Utensils**: The website encourages customers to choose reusable options and raises awareness about sustainability, helping restaurants achieve eco-friendly goals.

This solution is built primarily with Next.js and hosted on Vercel to ensure high performance and scalability. Cloud MongoDB supports the backend, storing user data, order history, and ingredient prices, making data management and expansion secure and efficient.

Overall, this digital transformation solution not only enhances operational efficiency but also promotes sustainability, reducing waste and supporting environmentally-conscious practices.
